Performance test statistics and comparision across models.

### ModelName - Performance

 - Device:
 - Batch Size:
 - DataSet: 
 - Input size (Approximate):

 - Training:
     - Time (per batch):
     - MemoryUtilization:
     - CPU Utilization: 
     - GPU Utilization:
 - Inference:
     - Time (per batch):
